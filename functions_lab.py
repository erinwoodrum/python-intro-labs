#Create a function called age_calculator that takes in two parameters (Two different years) and returns the difference of the two years:

def age_calculator(y1, y2): 
  return abs(y1 - y2)

print(age_calculator(1983, 2021))

#Define another function, avg_numbers that takes three parameters, that returns the average of three numbers.

def avg_numbers(n1, n2, n3):
  return((n1 + n2 + n3)/3)

print(avg_numbers(3, 6, 9))
